		%Type stuff here
		This project is designed to explore the Microservice Architecture (MSA) to develop a flexible E-commerce web system. The architecture will be explored by researching and discussing various principles, tenets, architectures and technologies that can be used to develop web systems using MSA. Due to the architecture being relatively new; only being discussed and implemented in the last few years. There is no official consensus on how this architecture can be implemented. There are several suggestions and ideas available that are discussed and explored by members of the profession. These include suggestions such as: incorporating current principles like single-responsibility principle, that is part of the SOLID principle. Enforcing Domain Driven Design (DDD) to create bounded context for microservices to operate within and define where communication between microservices may be needed, automated testing and deployment pipelines and DevOps. 
		
		Modern technologies such as containerisation (Docker and Kubernetes) and the Cloud (Azure and Amazon Web Services(AWS)) are being suggested for use with MSA. These forms of Virtualisation aid in promoting a distributed system design - suggested for MSA. Using the Cloud for deployment purposes has contributed to the development of web-based systems. Integrated Development Environments (IDE's) such as Visual Studio, Eclipse and IntelliJ are available for this.
